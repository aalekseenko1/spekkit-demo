# Feature Specification: Spending Analysis Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a modern web app for analyzing my spending and their categories. It should be a stateless app, so I'll provide you my bank statement as a CSV file. Use column name from the CSV as a default data structure with datatypes. Columnds will be - timestamp,type,description,status,amount USD,card,card holder name,original amount,original currency,cashback earned,category. You need to extract the data from it and craft a visualization for that with all the data, probably some charts, probably some tables and so on."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Upload and View Spending Data (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to upload my bank statement CSV file and immediately see my spending data visualized in a clear, organized way so I can understand my financial activity at a glance.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - getting data into the system and seeing it visually. Without this, no other features matter. It establishes the basic data flow and proves the concept works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a CSV file and verifying that all transactions appear correctly in a table view. Delivers immediate value by letting users see their complete transaction history in a structured format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the home page, **When** I select a CSV file with valid bank statement data and click upload, **Then** the system displays all transactions in a table with all columns visible (timestamp, type, description, status, amount USD, card, card holder name, original amount, original currency, cashback earned, category)

2. **Given** I have uploaded a CSV file, **When** the data loads successfully, **Then** I see a summary showing total number of transactions, date range of data, and total amount

3. **Given** I am viewing my transaction data, **When** I refresh the page or close the browser, **Then** I need to upload the CSV again (stateless behavior - no data persistence)

4. **Given** I have uploaded a CSV file, **When** I want to upload a different file, **Then** I can upload a new CSV which replaces the current data without requiring a page refresh

### User Story 2 - Analyze Spending by Category (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see my spending broken down by categories with visual charts so I can quickly identify where most of my money goes and make informed financial decisions.

**Why this priority**: Category analysis is the primary analytical value. Once users can see their data (P1), this provides the "why" and "where" insights that drive financial awareness and behavior change.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by uploading a CSV with categorized transactions and verifying that category breakdowns appear in both chart and summary views. Delivers value by revealing spending patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have uploaded spending data with category information, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see a pie chart showing spending distribution across all categories with percentages

2. **Given** I am viewing category analysis, **When** I look at the category breakdown, **Then** I see a list of categories sorted by total spending amount (highest to lowest) with dollar amounts and percentage of total

3. **Given** I have spending data across multiple categories, **When** I hover over a category in the pie chart, **Then** I see a tooltip with the category name, total amount, and percentage

4. **Given** I am viewing category data, **When** categories have zero spending, **Then** those categories are not displayed in the visualization

---

### User Story 3 - Track Spending Over Time (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to see how my spending changes over time so I can identify trends, seasonal patterns, and compare different time periods.

**Why this priority**: Time-based analysis adds depth to understanding but is less critical than knowing what you spend and where. Users get value from P1 and P2 first, then this enhances with temporal insights.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading a CSV spanning multiple months and verifying that time-series charts display correctly with proper date grouping. Delivers value by showing spending trends and patterns over time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have uploaded spending data spanning multiple months, **When** I view the time analysis section, **Then** I see a line or bar chart showing total spending by month

2. **Given** I am viewing time-based spending, **When** the chart displays, **Then** months are shown in chronological order with clearly labeled axes

3. **Given** I have spending data over time, **When** I view the monthly breakdown, **Then** I can see both total spending per month and average spending per month

4. **Given** I am analyzing time-based data, **When** I have transactions from multiple years, **Then** the visualization clearly indicates which year each data point belongs to

### User Story 4 - Analyze Multi-Currency and Cashback Data (Priority: P4)

As a user who travels or uses cashback cards, I want to see my original currency amounts and cashback earnings so I can understand the full picture of my international spending and rewards.

**Why this priority**: This is valuable for specific user segments (international travelers, cashback users) but not essential for the core spending analysis experience. Most users will benefit from P1-P3 first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading a CSV with multi-currency transactions and cashback data, then verifying that currency conversion information and cashback summaries display correctly. Delivers value for users with international transactions or rewards cards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have transactions in multiple currencies, **When** I view the transaction table, **Then** I can see both the original amount with currency code and the USD equivalent for each transaction

2. **Given** I have earned cashback on transactions, **When** I view the dashboard summary, **Then** I see total cashback earned across all transactions

3. **Given** I am analyzing spending, **When** I filter or view transactions, **Then** the system always displays amounts in USD for aggregations while preserving original currency information in the detail view

4. **Given** I have cashback data, **When** viewing category analysis, **Then** I can optionally see net spending (amount minus cashback) for a more accurate picture of actual costs

---

### User Story 5 - Filter and Search Transactions (Priority: P5)

As a user with many transactions, I want to filter and search my spending data so I can quickly find specific transactions or analyze subsets of my spending.

**Why this priority**: Filtering enhances usability for users with large datasets but is not essential for the initial analytical value. Users can derive insights from P1-P4 without filtering, though it becomes more valuable as transaction volume grows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading a large CSV file and verifying that filters correctly reduce the displayed data and all visualizations update accordingly. Delivers value by making large datasets manageable and enabling focused analysis.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have uploaded spending data, **When** I use the search box to type a description keyword, **Then** the transaction table shows only matching transactions and all charts update to reflect only the filtered data

2. **Given** I am viewing my transactions, **When** I select one or more categories from a filter dropdown, **Then** only transactions in those categories are displayed and visualizations update accordingly

3. **Given** I am filtering transactions, **When** I select a date range, **Then** only transactions within that range are shown and all analytics reflect the filtered period

4. **Given** I have applied multiple filters, **When** I want to see all data again, **Then** I can click a "Clear Filters" button to remove all active filters

5. **Given** I am filtering data, **When** filters are active, **Then** the system displays a clear indicator showing which filters are applied and the resulting transaction count

6. **Given** I have filtered my transaction data, **When** I click an "Export to CSV" button, **Then** the system downloads a CSV file containing only the currently filtered transactions with all original columns preserved

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user uploads a CSV file with missing or malformed data (e.g., missing columns, invalid dates, non-numeric amounts)?
- How does the system handle empty CSV files or files with only headers?
- What happens when a transaction has a category value that is blank or null?
- How does the system handle extremely large CSV files (10,000+ transactions)?
- What happens when dates are in different formats than expected?
- How does the system handle negative amounts (refunds, returns)?
- What happens when the same CSV file is uploaded multiple times?
- How does the system handle special characters in descriptions or category names?
- What happens when original currency is not specified but original amount is present?
- How does the system display data when all transactions are from a single day?
- What happens when a user tries to export data when no transactions match the current filters?
- How does the system handle export of very large filtered datasets (5,000+ transactions)?
