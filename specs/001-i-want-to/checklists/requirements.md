# Specification Quality Checklist: Spending Analysis Dashboard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASSED
- ✅ Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of React, Next.js, specific charting libraries)
- ✅ All content focuses on user needs (spending analysis, visualization, filtering)
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (business terminology, clear user stories)
- ✅ All mandatory sections present and complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED
- ✅ All clarification markers resolved (FR-018 now specifies CSV export for filtered transactions)
- ✅ All requirements are testable and unambiguous (clear acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid technology specifics (no mention of frameworks or tools)
- ✅ 21 acceptance scenarios defined across 5 user stories (including export functionality)
- ✅ 12 edge cases explicitly identified (including export edge cases)
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded (stateless CSV analysis, no persistence, browser-based)
- ✅ Assumptions documented (CSV format, browser requirements, file size limits)

### Feature Readiness - PASSED
- ✅ 20 functional requirements with clear, testable criteria
- ✅ 5 prioritized user scenarios (P1-P5) covering upload, analysis, time trends, multi-currency, filtering
- ✅ 10 measurable success criteria defined
- ✅ No implementation leakage detected

## Outstanding Items

None - all validation items passed.

## Notes

**SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING PHASE**

All clarifications have been resolved. The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement is needed.

**Resolution Summary:**
- FR-018 clarified: CSV export functionality for filtered transaction data confirmed

The spec demonstrates strong quality:
- Clear prioritization with independent, testable user stories
- Comprehensive edge case identification (12 edge cases)
- Technology-agnostic requirements and success criteria
- Well-documented assumptions and constraints
- Stateless architecture clearly defined
- Export functionality fully specified with acceptance criteria
