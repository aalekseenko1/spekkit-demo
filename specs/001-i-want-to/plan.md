# Implementation Plan: Spending Analysis Dashboard

**Branch**: `001-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-want-to/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a stateless web application for analyzing bank statement spending data. Users upload CSV files containing transaction data, and the system visualizes spending patterns through interactive charts, tables, and category breakdowns. All processing happens client-side without data persistence, ensuring privacy and simplicity. Technical approach: Next.js 15 App Router with React Server Components for initial rendering, client components for file upload and interactive visualizations using charting libraries (NEEDS CLARIFICATION on specific library).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Next.js 15.5.5, React 19.1.0
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, NEEDS CLARIFICATION (CSV parsing library: papaparse or csv-parse), NEEDS CLARIFICATION (charting library: recharts, chart.js, or visx)
**Storage**: N/A (stateless application - all data processing in-memory client-side)
**Testing**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (React Testing Library + Jest recommended per constitution, but testing is optional unless specified)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions), responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js 15 App Router single-page application)
**Performance Goals**: <3s upload-to-display for 1,000 transactions, <1s filter application, <2s initial page load
**Constraints**: Client-side only (no backend API), 10MB file size limit, handle up to 10,000 transactions without performance degradation
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user stateless application, ~5-8 main UI components, ~3-4 data processing utilities, 5 primary user stories

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Clean and Modular Code
✅ **PASS** - Feature design supports modular architecture with:
- CSV upload component (single responsibility)
- Data parsing service (DRY - reusable CSV parsing logic)
- Visualization components (separate chart, table, summary components)
- Filter logic as shared hooks/utilities
- Clear separation: data processing → state management → UI rendering

### Principle II: Next.js 15 App Router Architecture
✅ **PASS** - Aligns with Next.js 15 App Router:
- Will use `app/` directory structure
- Initial page renders as Server Component showing upload interface
- CSV upload and data visualization require `'use client'` (interactivity, file input, state)
- No API routes needed (client-side processing only)
- Leverage Metadata API for SEO
- Use next/dynamic for code-splitting charting library (performance optimization)

### Principle III: Type Safety First
✅ **PASS** - TypeScript with strict mode:
- Transaction interface with all 11 CSV columns typed
- Category, Summary, and TimePeriod interfaces defined
- All component props explicitly typed
- Type-safe CSV parsing with schema validation
- Discriminated unions for filter states

### Principle IV: Component Organization and Reusability
✅ **PASS** - Clear component organization:
- Page component in `app/page.tsx` (main dashboard)
- Reusable components in `src/components/`:
  - FileUpload (reusable across features)
  - TransactionTable (data display)
  - CategoryChart, TimeSeriesChart (visualizations)
  - FilterPanel (controls)
  - SummaryStats (metrics display)
- Data processing utilities in `src/lib/`:
  - csvParser.ts
  - dataAggregation.ts
  - filterUtils.ts
- Components sized appropriately (<150 lines each with focused responsibility)

### Principle V: Performance and Optimization
✅ **PASS** - Performance-first approach:
- Use next/dynamic for charting library (reduce initial bundle)
- React.memo for chart components (avoid re-renders on filter changes)
- useMemo for expensive aggregations (category totals, time series data)
- No images in MVP (N/A for next/image)
- Implement React Suspense with loading states during data processing
- Bundle size monitoring for charting library choice

### Code Quality Gates
- ✅ Type checking required (TypeScript strict mode)
- ✅ Linting with Next.js ESLint config
- ✅ Build success required
- ✅ Manual testing of upload → visualize → filter workflow
- ⚠️  Testing optional (not specified in feature spec)

**Gate Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - No constitutional violations. Proceed to Phase 0 research.

**Structure Decision**: Next.js 15 App Router single-project structure. This is a client-side web application with no backend services. All components follow Next.js 15 conventions with the `app/` directory for routing and pages, `components/` for reusable UI elements, `lib/` for business logic and utilities, and `types/` for TypeScript definitions. This structure aligns with Principle IV (Component Organization) and Principle II (Next.js 15 App Router Architecture) from the constitution.

## Post-Design Constitution Re-Check

**Date**: 2025-10-15 (after Phase 1 completion)

All design artifacts have been generated:
- ✅ research.md - Technology decisions documented
- ✅ data-model.md - Entity definitions complete
- ✅ contracts/transaction-types.ts - TypeScript interfaces defined
- ✅ quickstart.md - Developer onboarding guide created

### Re-validation Against Constitution

**Principle I: Clean and Modular Code**
✅ **STILL PASSING** - Design artifacts confirm modular architecture:
- Type definitions in contracts/ show clear separation of concerns
- Data model defines distinct entities with single responsibilities
- Quickstart guide demonstrates component isolation

**Principle II: Next.js 15 App Router Architecture**
✅ **STILL PASSING** - Confirmed alignment:
- Research selected papaparse (browser-optimized, works with 'use client')
- Research selected Recharts (React 19 compatible with override)
- No API routes needed (all client-side)
- Structure follows App Router conventions

**Principle III: Type Safety First**
✅ **STILL PASSING** - Enhanced with Phase 1:
- contracts/transaction-types.ts provides comprehensive type definitions
- Type guards implemented (isTransaction, hasActiveFilters)
- Constants defined for validation
- All entities have explicit TypeScript interfaces

**Principle IV: Component Organization and Reusability**
✅ **STILL PASSING** - Structure validated:
- Component tree documented in quickstart.md
- Clear separation: components/ (UI), lib/ (logic), types/ (definitions)
- Barrel exports pattern considered for clean imports

**Principle V: Performance and Optimization**
✅ **STILL PASSING** - Performance strategy confirmed:
- Research validated papaparse for 10,000-row performance
- Recharts optimization techniques documented
- Memoization strategy defined in quickstart.md
- Bundle size impact calculated (~120-130KB total added)

### Final Gate Status

✅ **ALL PRINCIPLES PASSING** - Design phase complete with no violations.

**Approved to proceed to Phase 2**: Task generation via `/speckit.tasks` command.

**Note**: Agent context update encountered path resolution issue (setup script created `001-modern-web-app` directory but actual feature is `001-i-want-to`). This is a tooling issue and does not affect constitutional compliance. Agent context can be manually updated if needed.
